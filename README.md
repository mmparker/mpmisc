This package provides a collection of functions used throughout the TB Clinic's
reporting system. Its two key functions are:

 - `connect_to_tbdbplus`: a function for creating architecture-appropriate
   ODBC connections to TBdbPlus, and

 - `dfprintif`: a function for pretty-printing data.frames in HTML, with
   arbitrary messages for zero-row data.frames.
